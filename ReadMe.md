## Description
Our project entails keeping students on track with their fee payments and giving them easy access to their status prior to the payment deadlines. It includes the following fetures:
### MVP Features
1. The user should be able to access a student dashboard where they can view their current fee balance and upcoming payment deadlines.  
2. The user should be able to access their details using a search button that highlights their fee payments and balances incase there is any and it gives an alert that the status is pending otherwise it is cleared.
3. The user should receive automatic notifications that send automatic reminders to students as payment deadlines approach.
4. The user can also access a communication channel, such as an announcement section, where administrators can post important information regarding fee payment precautions and consequences.
5. The user should be able to categorize the kind of installments they prefer to use and the various installments should have specific payment dates.
